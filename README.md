# 🎥 WhosNext

**whosnext.com** is an open-source alternative to Omegle, focused on **anonymous video chats** with a strong emphasis on **user safety** and **privacy**.

---

## 🌐 Vision

To build a real-time video-chat platform that enables safe and spontaneous conversations between strangers — while ensuring that inappropriate behavior is actively detected and blocked using AI/ML tools.

---

## 🛡️ Core Objectives

- 🔍 **Real-Time Monitoring**: Leverage AI/ML to detect nudity, violence, or any illegal activity in ongoing video streams.
- 🚫 **Auto-Banning System**: Instantly block users by IP if violations are detected.
- 🧹 **Privacy-First Storage**: Automatically delete screenshots and temporary media — keeping the database lightweight and user information secure.
- 🕵️ **Anonymous Yet Accountable**: Anonymous chats, but with backend-level checks to prevent misuse.
